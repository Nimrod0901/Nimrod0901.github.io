reverse-engineering this beautiful chrome app: Momentum

##Description Our chrome-extension-clone is inspired by a popular Chrome extension app called Momentum that has over 2.5 million users and is rated 4.5 of 5 stars from 9241 people. Download it in the Chrome App Store!

What does it do? Our chrome-extension-clone will gently take over your default home screen on Google Chrome with a new inspirational photo each day. It's not just a pretty picture! It will also assist you in making your days more productive with a daily reminder of your goal, a todo list, a place to save your favorite links, a pomodoro timer, and even a weather check.
